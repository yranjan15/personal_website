          <p>Taking a ride on a bicycle has been one of my favorite pastimes. I usally bike on city streets or near the mountain trails near my house. I haven't
              been able to go on a bike ride for a while since my bicycle was stolen at college. In the next few weeks I plan on purchasing a hybrid bicycle
              for commuting and riding on mountain trails.</p>

          <p>I have been taking tennis clases intermittently since I was a child and as a teenager as well. I try to watch professional games on tv whenever I can.
             However, I mostly enjoy tennis as a recreational activity. Lately I have been trying to practice my ground strokes and serves on a weekly basis. With these
             skills, I hope to improve the development of my tennis game. </p>

          <p>In my spare time, I enjoy making puzzles that contain 100s - 1000s of pieces. I feel as if solving a puzzle is a good way to clear your mind from the stress
             of all the current activities in my life. I will usually make a puzzle right after finishing all my finals at the end of the quarter. Though puzzles take
             a long time to solve, I feel very satisfied when the final image is constructed. </p>

          <p>Ever since I was a child, I have always enjoyed researching and learning more about cars. In fact, I actaully took an autoshop course in high school so
              I could learn more about car maintenance. My current automotive interests are in fully electric or hybrid electric vehicles as well as autonomous driving.
              As of right now, my favorite car is the porsche 918 spyder which is pictured on the left.</p>
